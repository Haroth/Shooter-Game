Shooter is in 1 vs 1 mode and it is possible to play player vs player or player vs bot. The biggest problem with this project was to create a method that returns a logical true if the enemy is visible. At the beggining the game was designed to aggregate states and control of the agent. That is why, it contains a lot of attributes and methods for it.
